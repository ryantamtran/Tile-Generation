The Modified Basemap is a simplified basemap that removes unneccesary labels such as airport, roadways, waterways, building outlines, water shadows, and tunnel labels. The basemap keeps points of interests labels such as Univeristy of Washington, city labels, and neighborhood labels as well with changing the water color to a dark blue and national parks to a dark green to stay consistent with the dark theme.
